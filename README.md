## 🧮 Technical Deep Dive: Mars Time Calculations

### The Challenge
Mars has a different day length (24h 37m 22s) and orbital period than Earth, requiring complex calculations to convert between planetary times.

### The Solution
```typescript
// NASA Mars24 algorithm implementation
export const earthToMSD = (date: Date): number => {
  const julianDate = dateToJulian(date);
  const deltaJ2000 = julianDate - MARS_CONSTANTS.J2000_EPOCH;
  return (deltaJ2000 - 4.5) / MARS_CONSTANTS.EARTH_TO_MARS_DAY_RATIO + 
         MARS_CONSTANTS.MSD_EPOCH_OFFSET;
};
```

### Why This Matters
- **Mathematical Programming**: Demonstrates ability to implement scientific algorithms
- **Precision Engineering**: All calculations verified against NASA reference data
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for continuous updates without performance impact

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone <repository-url>
cd mars-weather-dashboard
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:ci

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the live Mars clock in action.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

This project prioritizes **test coverage where it matters most**:

- **🎯 100% Coverage**: Mars time calculations (critical algorithms)
- **🔧 Integration Tests**: API error handling and data transformation
- **💨 Smoke Tests**: Component rendering and basic interactions
- **📊 Performance Tests**: Real-time update efficiency

```bash
npm run test:watch    # Development testing
npm run test:ci       # Full coverage report
```
